## Guide to use
The website is easy to use. First of all open the website [here](https://quality-city-life.netlify.app/).
<br>
At the top of the site you will see a search bar, type the name of the city you want information about. Don't worry about making typos, the autocomplete system is here to help you. Just click on the city name when it appears.
<br>
Looking down you can see a descriptive box with the name of the city, the state you belong to and a brief description of the city. On the left of the screen you can also see a series of scores useful for evaluating the city. The result is rounded to the nearest number on a scale of 1 to 10.
<br>
You can get the data of city present in the database.
